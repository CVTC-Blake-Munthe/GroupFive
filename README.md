Group Five Developer Capstone Project

This is a asp.net web application that is used to keep track of open work orders and repairs for a computer shop. This project
will help prevent work order sheets from getting lost or destroyed. The web application will also help clients create a service 
request form for their repair needs. Once a service request is submitted, it will send the request form to a email which will 
contain leads.
